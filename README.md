# Foundations-of-Data-Science

## Overview
This repository contains materials and resources for the *Foundation of Data Science* course offered at City College of San Francisco under the guidance of Professor Shawn Wings. The course leverages materials from the acclaimed [Data 8](https://data8.org/) curriculum created by the UC Berkeley Division of Computing, Data Science, and Information.

## Course Description
The *Foundation of Data Science* course introduces students to core concepts in data analysis, statistical reasoning, and computational thinking. Designed for students from diverse disciplines, the course equips learners with the tools to:

- Interpret and analyze data effectively.
- Pose meaningful questions and derive insights from data.
- Utilize inferential and computational methods to support findings.

This interdisciplinary course integrates knowledge from:
- Statistics
- Computer Science
- Writing and Communication

## Materials
The primary materials for this course are adapted from the **Data 8 Book** and other resources shared by UC Berkeley. These resources are designed to:
- Provide hands-on experience with data science techniques.
- Foster understanding of key concepts through practical examples.
- Encourage critical thinking and problem-solving.

## Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Explore and visualize data to identify patterns and trends.
2. Use statistical tools to draw inferences and make predictions.
3. Write clear and compelling narratives supported by data.
4. Apply computational methods to manipulate and analyze data effectively.

## Repository Structure
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks with lecture materials and exercises.
- **`data/`**: Datasets used throughout the course.
- **`assignments/`**: Homework and project guidelines.
- **`resources/`**: Supplementary materials and references.

## Prerequisites
No prior programming or statistical knowledge is required. However, a willingness to learn and engage with data-driven problems is essential.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used in the course.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive computing and hands-on learning.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**: Key libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

## Credits
This course is inspired by and uses materials from:
- [UC Berkeley Division of Computing, Data Science, and Information](https://data.berkeley.edu/)
- [Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science](https://data8.org/)
